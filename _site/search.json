    "section": "2.1 Critique",
    "text": "2.1 Critique\n\nClarity\n\n(a) Reverse formatting of Y-Axis:\nThe sequence of age-group was reversed (e.g. Top X-Axis Age Groups started from “0-4”, then “5-9” and “90 & Over” at the bottom), which could lead to misinterpretation of the graph as it is challenging for the user to interpret the pyramid overall shape at first glance. This is because the common sequence of age-groups is from oldest to youngest, and when the sequence is reversed, it can be difficult for the user to interpret the graph.\n\n\n(b) Unclear visualization title:\nThe task was to focus on 9 planning areas of Singapore, with breakdown by age group & gender. However, both essential components such as “Age Group” and “Gender” were not reflected in the original title “Singapore population distribution by age”. This can lead to confusion and misunderstanding of the scope of analysis as the title does not accurately reflect the key components of the analysis. Furthermore, without specifying the essential components, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the data. To better reflect the scope of the analysis, the title should be amended to “Population variation of Age and gender in the 9 most populated planning areas in Singapore”.\n\n\n(c) Redundant X-Axis:\nAs the male and female population are both colored differently in the chart, there is no need to add individual X-Axis for each graph in the trellis. We could add a legend in place of it. This would simplify the chart and make the chart more visually appealing since it would be less cluttered.\n\n\n(d) Inconsistent X-Axis across Planning Area & Gender:\nThere are different ranges for each X-axis for each planning area and gender. For instance, Jurong West may range from 0 to 60k, while Hougang may range from 0 to 45k. Having different X-Axis range for each planning area and gender will cause their values to appear greater or lesser than they actually are, thus skewing the results of the comparison. To ensure accurate comparison, the X-Axis range should be standardized across all planning areas and genders.\n\n\n(e) Absences of source:\nNo recognition of the data source nor author.\n\n\n\nAesthetics\n\n(f) Colours of Bar Chart is not purposeful:\nAlthough visually appealing, gradient colors in the graph convey little additional information to the reader. The use of gradient colors in a graph can be distracting and make it difficult for a reader to quickly identify the most significant points. Maximum population count for each planning area & gender can be highlighted to draw attention to points of interest.\n\n\n(g) Arrangement of planning areas is not purposeful:\nCurrently, the arrangement of the planning areas is in alphabetical order. We should arrange the planning areas with the highest population counts at the top left of the trellis, and the lowest population counts at the bottom right. It will also help with readability, as viewers will be able to quickly identify the most populated areas and compare their populations with the least populated areas."
